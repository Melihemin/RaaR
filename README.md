RaaR is an open source physical vehicle detection platform based on simple I/O.
RaaR can be used to locate objects. Can be made available by connecting to your computer with a USB.
For this, you need to download the JAVA 8 programming language.

## Contents of this repository

This repository contains just the code for the Arduino IDE itself.
Originally, it also contained the AVR and SAM Arduino core and libraries
(i.e.  the code that is compiled as part of a sketch and runs on the
actual Arduino device), but those have been moved into their own
repositories.  They are still automatically downloaded as part of the
build process and included in built releases, though.

The repositories for these extra parts can be found here:
-   Non-core specific Libraries are listed under: <https://github.com/Melihemin/RaaR/>
    (and also a few other places, see `build/build.xml`).

-   Other cores are not included by default but installed through the
    board manager. Their repositories can also be found under
    <https://github.com/Melihemin/>.

## Building and testing

Instructions for building the IDE and running unit tests can be found on
the wiki:
-   <https://github.com/Melihemin/RaaR/>
-   Install Java 8
-   Connect Your Microcontrollers
